<div class="body conbody"><div class="shortdesc">Because Apex is tightly integrated with the database, you can access Salesforce records
    and their fields directly from Apex. Every record in Salesforce is natively represented as an
      <dfn class="term">sObject</dfn> in Apex. For example, the Acme account record corresponds to an Account
    sObject in Apex. The fields of the Acme record that you can view and modify in the user
    interface can be read and modified directly on the sObject as well.</div>
<p class="p">The following table lists some populated fields of the Acme account example record. The
      Account sObject is an abstraction of the account record and holds the account field
      information in memory as an object.</p>
<div class="data colSort"><table class="featureTable sort_table" summary=""><caption><span class="tablecap">Table 1. Account sObject for a Retrieved Record</span></caption>

<p class="p">Each Salesforce record is represented as an sObject before it is inserted into Salesforce.
      Likewise, when persisted records are retrieved from Salesforce,  they’re stored in an sObject
      variable.</p>
<p class="p">Standard and custom object records in Salesforce map to their sObject types in Apex. Here are
      some common sObject type names in Apex used for standard objects.</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">Account</li>
<li class="li">Contact</li>
<li class="li">Lead</li>
<li class="li">Opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If you’ve added custom objects in your organization, use the API names of the custom objects
      in Apex. For example, a custom object called Merchandise corresponds to the Merchandise__c
      sObject in Apex.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading4">Creating sObject Variables</h3>
<p class="p">To create an sObject, you need to declare a variable and assign it to an sObject instance.
        The data type of the variable is the sObject type.</p>
<p class="p">The following example creates an sObject variable of type Account and assigns it to a new
        account with the name Acme.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme');
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading5">sObject and Field Names</h3>
<p class="p"> The names of sObjects correspond to the API names of the corresponding standard or custom
        objects. Similarly, the names of sObject fields correspond to the API names of the
        corresponding fields.</p>
<p class="p">API names of object and fields can differ from their labels. For example, the Employees
        field has a label of Employees and appears on the account record page as Employees but its
        API name is NumberOfEmployees. To access this field in Apex, you’ll need to use the API name
        for the field: NumberOfEmployees.</p>
<p class="p">The following are highlights of some rules used for API names for custom objects and custom
        fields. </p>
<p class="p">For custom objects and custom fields, the API name always ends with the __c suffix. For
        custom relationship fields, the API name ends with the __r suffix. For example:</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">A custom object with a label of Merchandise has an API name of Merchandise__c.</li>
<li class="li">A custom field with a label of Description has an API name of Description__c.</li>
<li class="li">A custom relationship field with a label of Items has an API name of Items__r.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In addition, spaces in labels are replaced with underscores in API names. For example, a
        custom field name of Employee Seniority has an API name of Employee_Seniority__c.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading6">Finding Object and Field Names</h3>
<p class="p">To find out the names of standard objects and their fields for use in Apex, refer to the
          <a class="xref" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.206.0.object_reference.meta/object_reference/" target="_blank" title="HTML (New Window)">Object Reference for Salesforce and
          Force.com</a>.</p>
<p class="p">For custom objects, look up the object and field API names in your org. From Setup, enter <kbd class="ph userinput">Objects</kbd> in the <span class="keyword parmname">Quick Find</span> box, then select <strong class="ph uicontrol">Objects</strong>, and then click your object’s name.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading7">Creating sObjects and Adding Fields</h3>
<p class="p">Before you can insert a Salesforce record, you must create it in memory first as an
        sObject. Like with any other object, sObjects are created with the <samp>new</samp> operator:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>Account acct = new Account();</pre></div>
<p class="p">The API object name becomes the data type of the sObject variable in Apex. In this example,
          <samp>Account</samp> is the data type of the <samp>acct</samp> variable.</p>
<p class="p">The account referenced by the <samp>acct</samp> variable is empty because we haven’t
        populated any of its fields yet. There are two ways to add fields: through the constructor
        or by using dot notation. </p>
<p class="p">The fastest way to add fields is to specify them as name-value pairs inside the
        constructor. For example, this statement creates a new account sObject and populates its
        Name field with a string value. </p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme');</pre></div>
<p class="p">The Name field is the only required field for accounts, which means that it has to be
        populated before being able to insert a new record. However, you can populate other fields
        as well for the new record. This example adds also a phone number and the number of
        employees.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme', Phone='(415)555-1212', NumberOfEmployees=100);</pre></div>
<p class="p">Alternatively, you can use the dot notation to add fields to an sObject. The following is
        equivalent to the previous example, although it takes a few more lines of code.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>Account acct = new Account();
acct.Name = 'Acme';
acct.Phone = '(415)555-1212';
acct.NumberOfEmployees = 100;</pre></div>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading8"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Working with the Generic sObject Data Type</span></h2>
<div class="body conbody"><div class="shortdesc">Typically, you use the specific sObject data type, such as Account for a standard
    object or Book__c for a custom object called Book, when working with sObjects. However, when you
    don’t know the type of sObject your method is handling, you can use the generic sObject data
    type.</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="p">Variables that are declared with the generic sObject data type can reference any Salesforce
        record, whether it is a standard or custom object record.</p>
<div class="fig fignone">
<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="A generic sObject variable can point to any Salesforce record" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us00cce42fb16c55ee922914d4b2383235.png"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p">This example shows how the generic sObject variable can be assigned to any Salesforce
        object: an account and a custom object called Book__c.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>sObject sobj1 = new Account(Name='Trailhead');
sObject sobj2 = new Book__c(Name='Workbook 1');</pre></div>
<p class="p">In contrast, variables that are declared with the specific sObject data type can reference
        only the Salesforce records of the same type.</p>
<div class="fig fignone">
<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="A specific sObject variable can point to the Salesforce record of the same type only" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usba372555470a67811e17c68936f39cf4.png"/></span></div>

</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading9">Casting Generic sObjects to Specific sObject Types</h3>
<p class="p">When you’re dealing with generic sObjects, you sometimes need to cast your sObject variable
        to a specific sObject type. One of the benefits of doing so is to be able to access fields
        using dot notation, which is not available on the generic sObject. Since sObject is a parent
        type for all specific sObject types, you can cast a generic sObject to a specific sObject.
        This example shows how to cast a generic sObject to Account.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>// Cast a generic sObject to an Account
Account acct = (Account)myGenericSObject;
// Now, you can use the dot notation to access fields on Account
String name = acct.Name;
String phone = acct.Phone;</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading10">Tell Me More...</h3>
<p class="p">Unlike specific sObjects types, generic sObjects can be created only through the
          <samp>newSObject()</samp> method. Also, the fields of a generic sObject can be
        accessed only through the <samp>put()</samp> and <samp>get()</samp> methods.</p>
<p class="p">In this unit, you’ve learned what sObjects are and how to use them. However, creating an
        sObject doesn’t persist it as a record in the database. To save the sObject as a record, and
        do other things with it, use the Data Manipulation Language (DML). To retrieve a record, use
        the Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL). Check out later units to learn about DML and
        SOQL.</p>
