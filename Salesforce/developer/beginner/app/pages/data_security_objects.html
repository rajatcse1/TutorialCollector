<div class="body">
<p class="p">Object-level security provides the simplest way to control data access. By
                        setting permissions on a particular type of object, you can prevent a group
                        of users from creating, viewing, editing, or deleting any records of that
                        object. </p>
<div class="p">There are two ways of setting object permissions. You can use profiles or
                        permission sets. <ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">Profiles determine the objects a user can access and the
                                        permissions a user has on any object record (Create, Read,
                                        Edit, and Delete). </li>
<li class="li">Permission sets grant <em class="ph i">additional</em> permissions and access
                                        settings to users.</li>
</ul>

<div class="box message confirm"><div class="inner"><div class="bd"><div class="media"><img alt="Tip" class="img mtm" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us6da477d97c76333bb64f0d69f440dc0d.gif"/><div class="mediaBd"><h4 class="mbs">Tip</h4><p>The key difference between the two is that users can have
                                only one profile but they can have many permission sets. This means
                                you can use profiles to grant the minimum permissions and settings
                                that all users of a particular type need and then use permission
                                sets to grant additional permissions. The combination of profiles
                                and permission sets gives you a great deal of flexibility in
                                specifying object-level access. </p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p class="p">As an example, let’s explore how you might configure object-level access
                                in the Recruiting app we mentioned earlier. The app has four main
                                types of users: hiring managers, recruiters, interviewers, and
                                standard employees. Let’s consider the kinds of access each type of
                                user needs to the key custom objects in the app. </p>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Required Permissions for Hiring Managers</dt>
<dd class="dd">Ben, a hiring manager, should be able to access the
                                                recruiting records related to his open positions,
                                                but shouldn't have access to other recruiting
                                                records (unless they're owned by other hiring
                                                managers who report to him). Also, there are certain
                                                sensitive fields that he has no need to see, like
                                                the social security number field. Let’s consider the
                                                permissions Ben needs for each of the key custom
                                                objects in the app.<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Position</strong>—Ben should be able to
                                                  post new positions, as well as update and view all

                                                  manager, but he should only be able to view other
                                                  managers' positions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Candidate</strong>—Ben should only be

                                                  a position on which he's the hiring manager. Also,
                                                  since Ben has no reason to see a candidate's
                                                  social security number, this field should be
                                                  restricted from his view.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Job Application</strong>— Ben needs to be

                                                  rejected. However, he should not be able to change
                                                  the candidate listed on the job application, nor

                                                  so we'll have to find a way of preventing Ben from
                                                  updating the lookup fields on job
                                                  applications.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Review</strong>—To make a decision about
                                                  the candidates who are applying, Ben needs to see
                                                  the reviews posted by the interviewers, as well as
                                                  make comments on them if he thinks the interviewer
                                                  was being too biased in his or her review.
                                                  Likewise, Ben needs to be able to create reviews
                                                  so that he can remember his own impressions of the

                                implement these rules in the Recruiting app. As you’ll see, this
                                will require configuring security controls at all three levels:
                                objects, fields and records. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic nested0" id="data_security_objects_profiles" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"><a name="data_security_objects_profiles"></a>
<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading4"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Use Profiles</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">A profile is a collection
                        of settings and permissions that determine which data and features in the
                        platform users have access to. Settings determine what users can see, for
                        example, apps, tabs, fields, and record types. Permissions determine what
                        users can do, for example, create or edit records of a certain type, run
                        reports, and customize the app.</p>
<p class="p">Profiles control:</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">The standard and custom objects the user can view, create, edit, and
                                delete</li>
<li class="li">The object fields the user can view and edit</li>
<li class="li">The specific functions that users can perform, like viewing the Setup
                                menu and customizing applications</li>
<li class="li">The tabs the user can view in the app </li>
<li class="li">The standard and custom apps the user can access</li>
<li class="li">The Apex classes a user can execute</li>
<li class="li">The Visualforce pages a user can execute</li>
<li class="li">The page layouts a user sees</li>
<li class="li">The record types available to the user</li>
<li class="li">The hours during which the user can log in to the app</li>
<li class="li">The IP addresses from which the user can log in to the app</li>
<li class="li">The password policies, such as password length, complexity, and
                                expiration time</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Profiles are typically defined by a user's job function (for example, system
                        administrator, recruiter, or hiring manager), but you can have profiles for
                        anything that makes sense for your Salesforce org.
                        A profile can be assigned to many users, but a user can be assigned to only
                        one profile at a time. </p>
<div class="p">The platform includes a set of standard profiles. Some examples are: <ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">Read Only</li>
<li class="li">Standard User</li>
<li class="li">Marketing User</li>
<li class="li">Contract Manager</li>
<li class="li">System Administrator </li>
</ul>
Each standard profile includes a default set of permissions for all
                        standard objects available on the platform. For example, a Standard User can
                        create and edit records while a Read Only user can view records, but not
                        create or edit them. The System Administrator profile has the widest access
                        to data and the greatest ability to configure and customize Salesforce. The
                        System Administrator profile also includes two special permissions:<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">View All Data</li>
<li class="li">Modify All Data</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">These permissions override all other sharing settings, so use caution when
                        assigning them to any profile other than System Administrator. You can view
                        a list of all standard and custom profiles in the Administration Setup area,

<p class="p">You can never edit the object permissions on a standard profile. However, you can
                        clone any existing profile, and use that as the basis for a new profile,
                        adjusting the apps and system settings as needed. For example, in the
                        Recruiting app, you might create three new profiles, one each for
                        recruiters, interviewers, and hiring managers. Each profile can then be
                        configured to provide the specific type of data access required for a
                        particular role. You can then use permission sets to grant additional
                        permissions, as required (see the next unit for details). </p>

                                navigate, search, and modify settings for a profile. Permissions and
                                settings are organized into pages under app and system categories,
                                which reflect the rights users need to administer and use app and
                                system resources. This module describes the use of the enhanced

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading9"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Use Permission Sets</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">A permission set is a
                        collection of settings and permissions that give users access to various
                        tools and functions. The settings and permissions in permission sets are
                        also found in profiles, but permission sets extend users’ functional
                        access without changing their profiles. For example, to give users access to
                        a custom object, create a permission set, enable the required permissions
                        for the object, and assign the permission set to the users. You never have
                        to change profiles, or create a profile for a single use case. While users
                        can have only one profile, they can have multiple permission sets.</p>
<p class="p">Use permission sets to
                        grant additional permissions to specific users, on top of their existing
                        profile permissions, without having to modify existing profiles, create new
                        profiles, or grant an administrator profile where it’s not necessary. Here
                        are two common scenarios in which permission sets are useful. </p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">To grant access to custom objects or entire apps.</strong>
<p class="p">Let’s say you have many users in your organization with
                                        the same fundamental job functions. You can assign them all
                                        one profile that grants them all the access they need to do
                                        their job. But suppose a few of those users are working on a
                                        special project and they need access to an app that no one
                                        else uses. And suppose a few other users need access to that
                                        app, as well as another app that the first group
                                        doesn’t need. If we only had profiles, you’d
                                        have to create more profiles that were customized to those
                                        few users’ needs, or take your chances and add more
                                        access to the original profile, making the apps available to
                                        users that don’t need it. Neither of these options is
                                        ideal, especially if your organization is growing and your
                                        users’ needs change regularly. Permission sets make
                                        it easy to grant access to the various apps and custom
                                        objects in your organization, and to take away access when
                                        it’s no longer needed.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">To grant permissions—temporarily or long term—to
                                        specific fields.</strong>
<p class="p">For example, let’s say you have a user, Tom, who needs
                                        temporary edit access to a field while his co-worker is on
                                        vacation. You can create a permission set that grants access
                                        to the field and assign the permission set to Tom. When
                                        Tom’s co-worker returns from vacation and Tom no
                                        longer needs access to the field, you just remove the
                                        permission set assignment from Tom’s user record.

<p class="p">Now that you've seen how to create and modify profiles and permission
                                sets, let’s set up the appropriate object-level access for the
                                Recruiting app introduced earlier in the unit. The app has four main
                                types of users: recruiters, hiring managers, interviewers, and
                                standard employees. Here are the key considerations for deciding
                                whether to create a profile or permission set for each type of
                                user.</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recruiters</strong>—represent a clearly defined job
                                        function, and they need access to different types of data
                                        than other users. Hence, it makes sense to create a profile
                                        for recruiters.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hiring Managers</strong>—for most organizations, a hiring
                                        manager in Sales will need access to a different type of
                                        data than a hiring manager in Engineering. However, all
                                        hiring managers still need the same types of access to
                                        recruiting data—reviews, candidates, positions, and job
                                        applications. Hence, it’s convenient to create a hiring
                                        manager permission set that can be assigned to various types
                                        of users.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Interviewers</strong>—an employee from any department and
                                        in any job function might be called upon to perform an
                                        interview and requires access to recruiting information only
                                        for a limited amount of time. It makes sense to define a a
                                        permission set for interviewers, since permissions can be
                                        easily assigned and revoked as needed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Standard Employees</strong>—this is a generic group that
                                        doesn’t reflect a particular job function. For most
                                        employees, you can create a base profile that provides
                                        access to a small set of data, and then depending on what
                                        their specialties are, create and assign permission sets to
                                        give them more access as needed. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The above analysis suggests that the optimal way to configure
                                object permissions for the Recruiting app is as follows.</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">Create two profiles: Recruiters and Standard Employees</li>
<li class="li">Create two permission sets: Hiring Managers and Interviewers </li>
<li class="li">Assign the Standard Employee profile to hiring managers and
                                        interviewers, and then grant the appropriate permission set
                                        for their function</li>
</ul>
