<p class="p" dir="ltr">Choosing the data set each user or group of users can see is one of the
                        key decisions that affects the security of your app. Once you’ve designed
                        and implemented the data model for your app, it’s important to think about
                        the different types of users and the types of data they need access to. </p>
<p class="p" dir="ltr">For example, suppose you’re building a Recruiting app that contains
                        information about open positions, candidates, and job applications. The app
                        will store confidential data, such as social security numbers, salary
                        amounts, and applicant reviews that should only be exposed to specific types
                        of users. For such an app, it’s important to secure the sensitive data
                        without making it harder for recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers
                        to do their jobs.</p>
<p class="p" dir="ltr">The Force.com platform provides a flexible, layered sharing model that
                        makes it easy to assign different data sets to different sets of users. This
                        ensures you can balance security and convenience, minimizing the risk of
                        stolen or misused data while making sure all users can easily access the
                        data they need. </p>
<p class="p">The platform includes simple-to-configure security controls that make it easy to
                        specify which users can view, create, edit, or delete any record or field in
                        the app. You can configure access at the level of the organization, objects,
                        fields, or individual records. By combining security controls at different
                        levels, you can provide just the right level of data access to thousands of
                        users without having to specify permissions for each user individually. </p>
<div class="box message info"><div class="inner"><div class="bd"><div class="media"><img alt="Note" class="img mtm" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usb473bb5ea1b7e61dfb07e6a7e547de6b.gif"/><div class="mediaBd"><h4 class="mbs">Note</h4><p>Although you can configure the security and sharing model entirely using the
                        user interface, it is implemented at the API level. That means any
                        permissions you specify for objects, records, and fields apply even if you
                        query or update the data via API calls. This ensures the security of your
                        data is protected, regardless of how it is accessed.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading4"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Levels of Data Access</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">There are four main levels
                        at which you can configure access to data on the platform.</p>
<div class="p">
<dl class="dl detailList">
<dt class="dt dlterm"><strong class="ph b">Organization</strong></dt>
<dd class="dd">
<p class="p">At the highest level, you can secure access to
                                                  your organization by maintaining a list of
                                                  authorized users, setting password policies, and
                                                  limiting login access to certain hours and certain
                                                  locations. </p>
</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm"><strong class="ph b">Objects</strong></dt>
<dd class="dd">Object-level security provides the simplest way to
                                                control which users have access to which data. By
                                                setting permissions on a particular type of object,
                                                you can prevent a group of users from creating,
                                                viewing, editing, or deleting any records of that
                                                object. For example, you can use object permissions
                                                to ensure that interviewers can view positions and
                                                job applications but not edit or delete them.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm"><strong class="ph b">Fields</strong></dt>
<dd class="dd">You can use field-level security to restrict access to
                                                certain fields, even for objects a user has access
                                                to. For example, you can make the salary field in a
                                                position object invisible to interviewers but
                                                visible to hiring managers and recruiters. </dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm"><strong class="ph b">Records</strong></dt>
<dd class="dd">To control data with greater precision, you can allow
                                                particular users to view an object, but then
                                                restrict the individual object records they're
                                                allowed to see. For example, record-level access
                                                allows an interviewer to see and edit her own
                                                reviews, without exposing the reviews of other
                                                interviewers. You can manage record-level access in
                                                these four ways.</dd>

                                                  each role in the hierarchy should represent a

                                                  normally see. Sharing rules, like role
                                                  hierarchies, are only used to give additional
                                                  users access to records—they can’t be stricter
                                                  than your organization-wide default settings. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"><dfn class="term">Manual sharing</dfn></strong> allows

                        security features provided by Salesforce are preventative. To verify that
