<div class="body">
<p class="p">Salesforce offers a user role hierarchy that you can use together with sharing
                        settings to determine the levels of access users have to your organization’s
                        data. Users assigned to roles near the top of the hierarchy (normally the
                        CEO, executives, and other management) get to access the data of all the
                        users who fall directly below them in the hierarchy. </p>
<div class="p">Role hierarchies don't have to match your org chart exactly. Instead, each role
                        in the hierarchy should just represent a level of data access that a user or
                        group of users needs. The role hierarchy enables these behaviors:<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">A manager will always have access to the same data as his or her
                                        employees, regardless of the org-wide default settings. </li>
<li class="li">Users who tend to need access to the same types of records can
                                        be grouped together—we'll use these groups later when we
                                        talk about sharing rules. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Watch this video to get an overview of the different ways to manage record access
                        via roles.</p>
<p class="p"><iframe allowfullscreen="1" class="doc_embedded_video" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="1" src="//play.vidyard.com/CwsXBBl9WsU9qkVRytOx0A" webkitallowfullscreen="1" width="640"></iframe>
</p>
<p class="p">Depending on your
                        organization’s sharing settings, roles can control the level of visibility
                        that users have into your organization’s data. Users at any given role level
                        can view, edit, and report on all data owned by or shared with users below
                        them in the role hierarchy, unless your organization’s sharing model for an
                        object specifies otherwise. Specifically, in the Organization-Wide Defaults
                        related list, if the <span class="keyword parmname">Grant Access Using Hierarchies</span>
                        option is disabled for a custom object, only the record owner and users
                        granted access by the organization-wide defaults receive access to the
                        object's records.</p>
<p class="p">Beyond setting the
                        organization-wide sharing defaults for each object, you can specify whether
                        users have access to the data owned by or shared with their subordinates in
                        the hierarchy. For example, the role hierarchy automatically grants record
                        access to users above the record owner in the hierarchy. By default, the
                                <span class="keyword parmname">Grant Access Using Hierarchies</span> option is
                        enabled for all objects, and it can only be changed for custom objects.</p>
<p class="p">To control sharing access
                        using hierarchies for any custom object, click <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Security Controls</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Sharing Settings</strong></span> and <strong class="ph uicontrol">Edit</strong> in the Organization Wide
                        Defaults section. Deselect <span class="keyword parmname">Grant Access Using
                                Hierarchies</span> if you want to prevent users from gaining
                        automatic access to data owned by or shared with their subordinates in the
                        hierarchies.</p>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">Implementing a role
                        hierarchy in the platform is easy once you have an idea of what the
                        hierarchy should look like. It's best to start with your company's org chart
                        and then consolidate different job titles into single roles wherever
                        possible. For example, if a software development group has a staff software
                        engineer and a junior software engineer, these positions can be consolidated
                        into a single Software Engineer role in the hierarchy. Once that's done, you
                        can get started defining the role hierarchy itself.  </p>
<p class="p">To define a role
                        hierarchy:</p>
<ol class="ol enumList">
<li class="li">From Setup, enter <kbd class="ph userinput">Roles</kbd> in the <span class="keyword parmname">Quick Find</span> box, then select <strong class="ph uicontrol">Roles</strong>. If you see an introductory splash page called
                                Understanding Roles, click <strong class="ph uicontrol">Set Up Roles</strong> at
                                the bottom of the page to skip to the actual tool.<div class="fig fignone">
<span class="image image-block"><img alt='The Create Role Hierarchy page with the organization role hierarchy set to "Show in tree view"' class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us4b159171ee0fad5c75bd699c3bc7f5a6.jpg"/></span>
</div>
<p class="p">The default view for this page is the tree view, as
                                        indicated in the drop-down list on the far right side of the
                                        Role Hierarchy title bar. When creating a role hierarchy,
                                        it's probably easiest to stick with this or the list view,
                                        because they both make it easy to see how the roles all fit
                                        together in the hierarchy. The sorted list view is best if
                                        you know the name of a role that you want to find but aren't
                                        sure where it fits in the hierarchy, or if you don't want to
                                        click open all the tree nodes. For our purposes, we'll stick
                                        with the tree view.</p>
<div class="p">When you first start defining a role hierarchy, the tree view displays a single placeholder node
                                        with the name of your organization. From this point, we need
                                        to add the name of the role that is highest up in the
                                        hierarchy—in our case, the CEO.<div class="box message info"><div class="inner"><div class="bd"><div class="media"><img alt="Note" class="img mtm" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usb473bb5ea1b7e61dfb07e6a7e547de6b.gif"/><div class="mediaBd"><h4 class="mbs">Note</h4><p>If you're

<div class="body">
<p class="p">To illustrate the use of a role hierarchy, let's take a look at a branch of the
                        role hierarchy for a company using the Recruiting app. Remember, after
                        defining the organization-wide defaults, hiring managers are allowed to only
                        view all position, job posting, and employment website records, and to view
                        and update other recruiting records they own. That doesn't make our app all
                        that useful. However, by implementing the role hierarchy shown in the figure
                        below, you can open up access to specific types of records to various users
                        of the Recruiting app.</p>
<span class="image image-block"><img alt="The role hierarchy for the Universal Containers company" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us3fdec1403dbc536d1395c10c51b52302.jpg"/></span>
<div class="p"> The role hierarchy above
                        automatically grants the following kinds of record-level permissions. <ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">The CEO, Cynthia Capobianco, will be able to view and update
                                        every record that anyone else in the organization can view
                                        and update.</li>
<li class="li">The VP of Development, Andrew Goldberg, will be able to view and
                                        update any record that his managers or his managers'
                                        employees can view or update.</li>
<li class="li">The VP of Human Resources, Megan Smith, will be able to view and
                                        update any record that Phil Katz, her recruiting manager, or
                                        Mario Ruiz, Phil's recruiter, can view and update. </li>
<li class="li">The Recruiting Manager, Phil Katz, will be able to view and
                                        update any record that is owned by Mario Ruiz, his
                                        recruiter.</li>
<li class="li">The Software Development manager, Ben Stuart, will be able to
                                        view and update any record that is owned by Melissa Lee, Tom
                                        Zales, or Craig Kingman, his software engineers.</li>
<li class="li">The director of QA, Clark Kentman, will be able to view and
                                        update any record that is owned by Flash Stevenson or Harry
                                        Potterham, his QA Engineers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">As you can see, the role
                        hierarchy is very powerful in opening up data for people high up in the role
                        hierarchy tree! With organization-wide defaults and a role hierarchy in
                        place, you’re close to finishing up the record-level access permissions for
                        the Recuriting app. All that’s left is to share recruiting-related records
                        between groups that appear in separate branches of the role hierarchy, and
                        between peers in a single group. You can accomplish both of those tasks with
                        a combination of sharing rules and manual sharing.</p>
