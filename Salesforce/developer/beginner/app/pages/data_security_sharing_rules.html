<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading2"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Use Sharing Rules</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Your organization-wide default sharing settings give you a baseline level of access for each
      object. If the default access is too restrictive, you can open access back up to selected
      users with role hierarchies or sharing rules. Sharing rules represent automatic exceptions to
      your organization-wide default settings. If you have organization-wide sharing defaults of
      Public Read Only or Private, you can define rules that give more users access to records they
      do not own. </p>
<p class="p">You can create sharing
      rules based on record owner or field values in the record. This enables you to make automatic
      exceptions to your organization-wide sharing settings for defined sets of users. For example,
      use sharing rules to extend sharing access to users in public groups or roles. As with role
      hierarchies, sharing rules can never be stricter than your organization-wide default settings.
      They simply allow greater access for particular users.</p>
<p class="p">Watch this video to get an overview of the different ways to grant access to records using
      sharing rules.</p>
<p class="p"><iframe allowfullscreen="1" class="doc_embedded_video" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="1" src="//play.vidyard.com/pC88Jy7-Q3e4R51zh1XFYA" webkitallowfullscreen="1" width="640"></iframe>
</p>
<div class="p">Each sharing rule has three components:<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Share which records?</strong> You can share records owned by certain users or meeting
          certain criteria. Criteria-based sharing rules determine what records to share based on
          field values other than ownership. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">With which users? </strong>You can define groups of users by role or by defining a public
          group. A public group is an administrator-defined grouping of users that can be used to
          simplify the creation of sharing rules. Each public group can be a combination of:<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">individual users</li>
<li class="li">roles</li>
<li class="li">roles and subordinates</li>
<li class="li">other public groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">What kind of access?</strong> You can assign either Read-Only or Read/Write access.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Sharing rules work best when they're defined for a particular group of users that you can
      determine or predict in advance, rather than a set of users that frequently changes. For
      example, in the Recruiting app, it’s important to share every position, candidate, job
      application, and review with every recruiter. Since recruiters all belong to either the
      Recruiting Manager or Recruiter roles in the role hierarchy, we can easily use a sharing rule
      to share those objects with the Recruiting Manager role and its subordinates.</p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, consider another use case from the Recruiting app: interviewers need read
      access on the candidates and job applications for people they're interviewing. In this case,
      the set of interviewers is a lot harder to predict in advance—hiring managers might use
      different sets of interviewers depending on the position for which they're hiring, and the
      interviewers might come from different groups in the role hierarchy. So, this use case
      probably shouldn't be handled with sharing rules—the team of interviewers for any given
      manager is just too hard to predict. </p>
<div class="p">Let's go through the set of required permissions we still want to implement and pick out the
      ones that would work best with sharing rules:

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading3"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Define a Public Group</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Before creating a sharing rule, it’s
      important to set up the appropriate public group. A public group is a collection of individual
      users, other groups, individual roles, and/or roles with their subordinates that all have a
      function in common. For example, users with the Recruiter profile as well as users in the SW
      Dev Manager role both review job applications. </p>
<p class="p">Using a public group when defining a
      sharing rule makes the rule easier to create and, more important, easier to understand later,
      especially if it's one of many sharing rules that you're trying to maintain in a large
      organization. You'll need to create a public group if you ever want to define a sharing rule
      that encompasses more than one or two groups or roles, or any individual.</p>
<p class="p">Looking at the required permissions
      that we want to implement, there are just two objects that need a public group for their
      sharing rules: Job Application and Review. The good news is that we can cover these objects in
      a single group because the Review object is on the detail side of a master-detail
      relationship, so it inherits the sharing settings we apply to the Job Application object.
      Since both recruiters and hiring managers need read and update access to job applications and
      reviews, we can define a public group called Reviewers that includes both recruiters and
      hiring managers.</p>

          with several custom objects.</p>
<p class="p">If you had chosen Review instead of Job Application,
          you wouldn’t have the option of creating sharing rules, since you can’t

          you chose Job Application, a Sharing Rules related list appears. Let’s use that to create
          a sharing rules that will apply to both the Job Application and the Review

<div class="body">
<p class="p">A record owner can share
                        individual records with other users by using the Share button on the record.
                        This method of granting access is also known as a manual share. In some
                        cases, granting access to one record includes access to all its associated
                        records.  For example, if you grant another user access to an account, the
                        user will automatically have access to all the opportunities and cases
                        associated with that account. </p>
<p class="p">Sometimes it’s impossible to define a consistent group of users who need
                        access to a particular set of records. In those situations, record owners
                        can use manual sharing to give read and edit permissions to users who would
                        not have access to the record any other way. <span class="ph" id="manual_not_automated"><a name="manual_not_automated"></a>Although manual sharing isn’t automated like

                                rules, it gives record owners the flexibility to share particular
                                records with users that need to see them. Furthermore, record owners
                                can easily remove the manual shares if the access is not needed

<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading6">Manual Sharing in the Recruiting App</h3>
<div class="p">After implementing the sharing rules for the Recruiting app, the
                                following required permissions remain: <ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">Hiring managers need read and update access on position
                                                records on which they're the hiring manager. </li>
<li class="li">Hiring managers need read access on candidate records on
                                                which they're the hiring manager.</li>
<li class="li">Interviewers need read access on the candidate and job
                                                application records for people they're interviewing.
                                        </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">It’s difficult to assign these permissions using sharing rules because
                                there’s no way to define a consistent group of users who would need
                                access to a particular set of records. It makes more sense for the
                                person who owns a record to grant access to specific users, when
                                required. </p>
<p class="p">For example, a recruiter, like Mario, who owns the position, candidate,
                                and job application records for jobs he's trying to fill, also knows
                                the hiring manager and interviewers who should be assigned to them.
                                Mario can use manual sharing to grant read or read/write access on
                                records that he owns to any other user, role, or public group. </p>
<p class="p">Although it isn't automated like organization-wide defaults, role
                                hierarchies, or sharing rules, manual sharing gives Mario the
                                flexibility to share particular records with the ever-changing
                                groups of interviewers and hiring managers he works with every day.
                                With this final step, we’ve implemented all of the required sharing
                                and security settings, which we discussed at the beginning of this
                                module, for the Recruiting app.</p>
