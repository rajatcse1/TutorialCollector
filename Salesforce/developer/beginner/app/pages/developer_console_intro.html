An asteroid is hurtling toward your spaceship. You, as the commander of the
            spaceship, are responsible for your crew’s safety. Luckily, your ship is powered by Salesforce, so you have a
            handy console where you can monitor and program your systems as you prepare to take
            evasive action. </div>
<p class="p">Similarly, you can steer your company’s Salesforce org toward customer
            success using the Developer Console.
            So, here comes the first question that you likely have before taking the controls: What
                <em class="ph i">is</em> the Developer Console? </p>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">The Developer Console is an integrated
            development environment (more typically called an IDE) where you can create, debug, and
            test apps in your org. </p>
<div class="p">It’s your one-stop solution for a variety of development tasks.<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">Navigate, open, create, and edit Apex classes
                    and triggers, Lightning
                    components, and Visualforce pages and
                    components.</li>
<li class="li">Browse packages that you’ve created or installed in your org.</li>
<li class="li">Generate logs for debugging and analyze them using different perspectives.</li>
<li class="li">Test your Apex code to ensure that it’s error free.</li>
<li class="li">Identify and resolve errors by setting checkpoints in your Apex

<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading3"> When Do You Use the Developer Console?</h3>
<p class="p">Now that you’re in the cockpit, you’re probably looking at the different options available to
                control your Salesforce-powered spaceship. To control a Salesforce org, some of
                the options available to you are the Force.com IDE, the
                    Developer Console, and
                third-party developer tools like the ones that you can download from AppExchange.</p>
<p class="p">The Developer Console is connected
                to one org and is browser-based. If you want your changes to be effective
                immediately and you don’t want to install anything on your computer, we recommend
                the Developer Console. If you want
                to connect to multiple orgs, compare or synchronize files, or use version control,
                    Force.com IDE
                is your best option.</p>

                have version control or conflict resolution. To avoid overwriting other people’s

                share with your teammates. </p></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading5"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Set Up Your Workspace</span></h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">After you’ve opened the Developer Console, the next
            step is to decide how to set up your workspace.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading6">What Is a Workspace?</h3>
<p class="p">If your pit stops are on the Moon and Mars, you have a different set of system checks
                and flight paths for each location. It would be confusing and overwhelming to have
                information about landing on Mars in front of you while you maneuvered your
                spaceship toward the Moon. Similarly, workspaces in the Developer Console help you
                organize information to show just what you need as you work on each of your
                development tasks. Although it sounds like a fancy term, a workspace is simply a
                collection of resources, represented by tabs, in the main panel of the Developer Console. You can create
                a workspace for any group of resources that you use together.</p>
<p class="p">If you’re working on two different projects, you can have the related code, tests,
                and logs open simultaneously in separate workspaces. For instance, say you’re
                writing code to update some records for your engineering team, but you also want to
                check the system details for your navigation team. You can create two workspaces,
                each of which contains only the resources relevant to the project. Workspaces reduce
                clutter and make it easier to navigate between different resources.</p>
<p class="p">When you use the Developer Console
                for the first time, you see the default workspace. Setting up your own workspace is
                easy. Let’s try it out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading7">Set Up Your Own Workspace</h3>
<div class="p">
<p class="p">Select <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Workspace</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">New Workspace</strong></span> and give your workspace a name. In your new workspace, you can create
                    Apex
                classes, Lightning
                components, Visualforce
                pages, and more.</p>
<p class="p">You can switch between your workspaces by selecting <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Workspace</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Workspace Manager</strong></span>
<span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Workspace</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Switch Workspace</strong></span> (1). In this way, you can work with code and analyze logs for each
                project just by opening a different workspace.</p>
