<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">As a good commander, you review the system logs to check that everything is in working order.
            Logs are one of the best places to identify problems with a system or program. Using the
                Developer Console, you can look at
            various debug logs to understand how your code works and to identify any performance
            issues. </p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading3">View Logs in the Text Editor</h3>
<p class="p">Viewing a debug log is simple. To generate a log, let’s execute the <samp>EmailMissionSpecialist</samp>
                Apex class that
                you created earlier.</p>
<div class="p">You can view your log in two ways.<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Before execution</strong>, enable <strong class="ph uicontrol">Open Log</strong> in the Enter
                            Apex
                        Code window. The log opens after your code has been executed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">After execution</strong>, double-click the log that appears in the Logs
                        tab.</li>
</ul>
Let’s try the first method.<ol class="ol enumList">
<li class="li">Select <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Debug</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Open Execute Anonymous Window</strong></span>.</li>
<li class="li">The Enter Apex
                        Code window displays the last code that you entered for execution. If it’s
                        different from the following code, delete it and paste the following code.
                        Be sure to replace <var class="keyword varname">Enter your email address</var> with your
                        email

</div>
<p class="p">The execution log that you see probably seems like a confusing jumble of numbers and
                words, so let’s talk about how you can read and understand log data.<div class="imageleft"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Log Results" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-useff1b57e847387484e00aa738760269e.png"/></span></div></p>

<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading4">Read Your Log Data</h3>
<p class="p">Let’s run the <samp>EmailMissionSpecialist</samp> class
                again, but this time let’s introduce an error. Then, let’s find the resulting log in
                the Logs tab.</p>
<div class="p">

</li>
<li class="li">Click <strong class="ph uicontrol">OK</strong>, and then double-click the new log in the
                        Logs tab. If you’re not sure which log is newest, click the heading for the
                        Time column to sort the logs by the time when they were generated.<div class="imageleft"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Log Results" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us9ddbbb0b1c14720b8fddf9617ce25bf6.png"/></span></div></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="p">You can read a debug log by identifying what each column represents.<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Timestamp</strong>—The time when the event occurred. The timestamp is always
                        in the user’s time zone and in HH:mm:ss:SSS format.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Event</strong>—The event that triggered the debug log entry. For instance, in
                        the execution log that you generated, the <samp>FATAL_ERROR</samp> event is logged when the email address is
                        determined to be invalid. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Details</strong>—Details about the line of code and the method name where the
                        code was executed.</li>
</ul>
<div class="imageleft"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Log Results View Options" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us518a920acf256a397ce1591718e308ee.png"/></span></div></div>
<p class="p">You can change what you see in the Execution Log by selecting <strong class="ph uicontrol">This
                    Frame</strong> (a), <strong class="ph uicontrol">Executable</strong> (b), or
                    <strong class="ph uicontrol">Debug Only</strong> (c). Selecting these options shows you only
                certain types of events. For instance, Debug Only shows <samp>USER_DEBUG</samp> events. You can also filter different parts of the log
                using <strong class="ph uicontrol">Filter</strong> (d). Enter a method name, or any other text you
                are specifically looking for, and the log filters your results. </p>
<p class="p">You can also view the debug log as a raw log, which shows you more information.
                Select <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">File</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Open Raw Log</strong></span>. The timestamp in a raw log shows the time elapsed in nanoseconds (in
                parentheses) since the start of the event.</p>

<div class="imageleft"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Timestamp, Event and Details in a Log" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us16e2e892698f0d92857bc77d07e80500.png"/></span></div>
</p>
<p class="p">This combination of the timestamp, event, and details provides valuable insights into
                how your code works and the errors that occur.</p>
<p class="p">While all this information is great, what if you want to quickly look for certain
                values in the debug log? After all, you have many other responsibilities as
                commander. An excellent way to do so is to use the <samp>System.debug()</samp> method in Apex. </p>
<p class="p">The great thing about <samp>System.debug()</samp> is that
                you can add it anywhere in your code to track values, helping you debug your own
                code.</p>
<div class="p">Here is the syntax for <samp>System.debug()</samp>. To
                display a

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading5"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Use the Log Inspector</span></h2>
<div class="body conbody">
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading6">What Is the Log Inspector?</h3>
<p class="p">The handy Log Inspector exists to make it easier to view large logs! The Log
                Inspector uses log panel views to provide different perspectives of your code. Check
                it out by selecting <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Debug</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">View Log Panels</strong></span>.</p>
<p class="p">Log panels change the structure of the log, to give other helpful information about
                the context for the code being executed. For example, different panels show the
                source, execution times, heap size, and calling hierarchy. (We know, more geek
                speak—this section is relatively technical. Remember, we’re getting to know the Developer Console, not the finer
                points of debugging. So if anything doesn’t make sense to you, try not to worry
                about it too much.)</p>
<p class="p">These log panels interact with each other to help you debug your own code. For
                instance, when you click a log entry in the Execution Log or Stack Tree, the other
                panels (Source, Source List, Variables, and Execution Stack) refresh to show related
                information. <div class="imageleft"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="All Log Panels" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us1898c823d3505491101c4066bacc6f2e.png"/></span></div></p>
<div class="p">These panels are available in the Log Inspector.<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Stack Tree</strong>—Displays log entries within the hierarchy of their objects
                        and their execution using a top-down tree view. For instance, if one class
                        calls a second class, the second class is shown as the child of the
                        first.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Execution Stack</strong>—Displays a bottom-up view of the selected item. It
                        displays the log entry, followed by the operation that called it. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Execution Log</strong>—Displays every action that occurred during the
                        execution of your code. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Source</strong>—Displays the contents of the source file, indicating the line
                        of code being run when the selected log entry was generated.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Source List</strong>—Displays the context of the code being executed when the
                        event was logged. For example, if you select the log entry generated when
                        the faulty email address value was entered, the Source List shows <samp>execute_anonymous_apex</samp>.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Variables</strong>—Displays the variables and their assigned values that were
                        in scope when the code that generated the selected log entry was run.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Execution Overview</strong>—Displays statistics for the code being executed,
                        including the execution time and heap size.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading7">What Is the Perspective Manager and How Can You Switch Perspectives?</h3>
<p class="p">A perspective is a layout of grouped panels. For instance, the predefined Debug
                perspective displays the Execution Log, Source, and Variables, while the Analysis
                perspective displays the Stack Tree, Execution Log, Execution Stack, and Execution
                Overview. </p>
<p class="p">You can choose a perspective by selecting <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Debug</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Switch Perspectives</strong></span> or <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Debug</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Perspective Manager</strong></span>. Yes, it’s as easy as switching between different communication
                panels—and much easier than trying to decipher logs from your Mission Specialist,
                Earth Space Station, and Mars Mission Control all in the same view. </p>
<p class="p">You can also create your own perspective. Configure your preferred combination of
                panels to display, and then select <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Debug</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Save Perspective As</strong></span>. Enter a name for your perspective, and then click
                    <strong class="ph uicontrol">OK</strong>.</p>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">You’re aware that Engine 3 has problems running smoothly at times. Having this engine running at
            capacity is critical as you steer to avoid asteroid 2014 QO<sub class="ph sub">441</sub>. But every
            time you try to run a systems check, you also get information from a depressed robot in
            your spaceship. It sends garbled reports predicting a robot uprising, increasing the
            number of lines in your log—and possibly making you miss valuable information.</p>
<p class="p">You need a way to control the amount of information logged. Luckily for you, the Developer Console does just that with
            the help of log categories and log levels. </p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading9">Log Categories</h3>
<p class="p">A log category is the type of information that is being logged.</p>
<div class="p">Here are two common log categories.<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">ApexCode</strong>, which logs events related to Apex
                        code and includes information about the start and end of an Apex
                        method.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Database</strong>, which includes logs related to database events, including
                        Database Manipulation Language (DML), SOSL, and
                            SOQL
                        queries (something we get into later).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading10">Log Levels and How to Change Them</h3>
<p class="p">It seems that Engine 3 is having problems again. As you’re going through the logs to
                see what could have caused these problems, you see warning messages about the
                uprising from the melancholy robot. </p>
<p class="p">One robot does not an uprising make, so you’re not too worried about the warnings.
                The faulty engine, however, is an urgent concern. What if you lose track of the
                actual messages from Engine 3 buried in all that log data? Log levels to the
                rescue!</p>
<div class="p">Log levels control how much detail is logged for each log category. The following
                levels are available in the Developer Console, from the least
                amount of data logged (level = <samp>NONE</samp>) to the
                most (level = <samp>FINEST</samp>).<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><samp>NONE</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp>ERROR</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp>WARN</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp>INFO</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp>DEBUG</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp>FINE</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp>FINER</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp>FINEST</samp></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Logging levels are cumulative. For instance, if the log level is <samp>INFO</samp> for an event, log information at the <samp>ERROR</samp> and <samp>WARN</samp>
                levels is also included. But if your log level is <samp>ERROR</samp>, you get only error messages. You don’t get warning messages or
                any other log information for that log category.</p>
<p class="p">The information a log level provides also depends on the log event. Different log
                events start logging at particular log levels. For instance, some ApexCode events
                start logging at <samp>INFO</samp>. If you set <samp>ERROR</samp> as the log level, you don’t get any log
                information for those events.</p>
<p class="p">To get the information you’re looking for, modify the log levels for different
                events. You want to suppress logging when the robot saves messages about the
                supposed uprising to the database. So, set the log level for the Database (<samp>DB</samp>) category to <samp>NONE</samp> or <samp>ERROR</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">You can set these levels by selecting <span class="ph menucascade"><strong class="ph uicontrol">Debug</strong> | <strong class="ph uicontrol">Change Log Levels</strong></span>. <div class="imageleft"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Select Log Levels" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us0551da75caefc2a5e80a367c5be7c5b2.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">On the General Trace Settings for You tab, click <strong class="ph uicontrol">Add/Change</strong>
                (1). In the Change DebugLevel window, choose the log level for each category.
                Remember, use log levels judiciously. If your log level is <samp>FINEST</samp> (2), your code can hit log limits and take
                longer to run. Don’t worry if you don’t see all the levels when you update the log
                level for a category. Only the levels that add more logging for the category are
                listed.</p>
<p class="p">Fortunately, once you’ve disabled logging for the robot’s warnings you find it easy
                to identify the problem with Engine 3: Its coolant level is low. You dispatch an
                engineer to add more coolant. While you’re at it, you ask the engineer to oil the
                robot’s joints. You hope that the fresh lubricant makes the robot a bit happier.</p>
