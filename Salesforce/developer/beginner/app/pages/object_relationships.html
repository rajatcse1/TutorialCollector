<div class="body">
<p class="p">The Force.com database differs from relational databases in the way that record
                        relationships are implemented. Instead of defining relationships through
                        primary keys and foreign keys, the database uses relationship fields. A
                        relationship field is a custom field on an object record that contains a
                        link to another record. </p>
<p class="p">Just as a personal relationship is a two-way association between two people, in
                        terms of relational data, a relationship is a two-way association between
                        two objects. Without relationships, you could build out as many custom
                        objects as you can think of, but they'd have no way of linking to one
                        another.</p>
<p class="p">With relationships, you can display data about other related object records on a
                        particular record's detail page. A relationship field stores the ID of the
                        parent record in a relationship, as well as optionally providing user
                        interface representations in both the parent and child records. </p>

<p class="p">For example, suppose you’re building a recruiting app that contains custom
                        objects for Position and Job Application. If you define a relationship
                        between the Position and Job Application objects, each position record can
                        have a related list of all the job applications for candidates who have
                        applied for the position. Then a job application record can have a link to
                        each position for which that candidate is applying.</p>

</h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">There are two main types of relationship fields. </p>
<dl class="dl detailList">
<dt class="dt dlterm"><span class="ph" id="Lookup"><a name="Lookup"></a>Lookup</span></dt>
<dd class="dd">This creates a relationship that links one object to another object. The relationship
          field allows you to navigate from records in one object to the related records in another
          object (both visually and programmatically). Lookup relationships can be used to create
          one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. When you define a lookup relationship, you have
          the option to include a lookup field on the page layouts for that object as well as create
          a related list on the associated object's page layouts. </dd>
<dd class="dd">For example, if you create a lookup relationship field on a Job Application object that
          references position records, many job application records can be related to a single
          position record. This will be reflected both with a new <span class="keyword parmname">Position</span>
          field on the job application record and with a new Job Applications related list on the
          position record. You can also put multiple lookup relationship fields on a single object,
          which means that the Job Application object can also point to a Candidate object.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm"><span class="ph" id="MD"><a name="MD"></a>Master-Detail</span></dt>
<dd class="dd">This creates a special type of relationship between two objects (the child, or detail)
          and another object (the parent, or master). This type of relationship closely links
          objects together such that the master record controls certain behaviors of the detail and
          subdetail record. In a master-detail relationship, the ownership and sharing of detail
          records are determined by the master record, and when you delete the master record, all of
          its detail records are automatically deleted along with it. Master-detail relationship
          fields are always required on detail records.</dd>
<dd class="dd">Master-detail relationships can be used whenever there is a tight binding between two
          objects. For example, say your recruiting app has a Review custom object that contains an
          interviewer's feedback on a job application. If you delete a job application record, you
          will probably want all of its review records deleted as well. In this case, you would
          create a master-detail relationship on the Review custom object with the Job Application
          object as the master object.</dd>

            fields. These fields store values aggregated from the child records in the relationship.
            For example, you can use these fields to count the number of child records, sum values
            in field of a child record, or determine the maximum/minimum of a field in a filtered
            set of child record. </p></div></div></div></div></div>

<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading5">Differences Between Lookup and Master-Detail Relationships</h3>
<p class="p">There are fundamental differences between the two types of relationships in areas such as
        data deletion, sharing, and required fields in page layouts. </p>
<div class="p">Master-detail relationships are typically used when there is a direct dependency between
        the two objects. These relationships have the following unique features. <ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">You can’t create a detail record without a master record.</li>
<li class="li">When you delete a master record, all its detail records are automatically
            deleted.</li>
<li class="li">The detail record inherits sharing rules from the master record. </li>
<li class="li">The number of master-detail relationships you can use are limited, depending on your
            edition and license.</li>
<li class="li">You can’t set profile object permissions for a detail record. The detail record
            inherits permissions from the master record.</li>
<li class="li">Master-detail relationships are automatically included in report record types.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p">Lookup relationships are appropriate when a relationship between two objects is required in
        some cases, but not always. Typical scenarios for lookup relationships are:<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">To reference commonly shared data, such as reference data. </li>
<li class="li">To relate multiple parent records to the child record.</li>
<li class="li">To link two objects together when you don't want the behavior of the master-detail
            relationship, such as sharing rules, profile permissions and cascade delete.</li>
<li class="li">If the detail object has its own tab, then you probably want to use a lookup, and not
            a master-detail, relationship.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">You can convert a master-detail relationship to a lookup relationship as long as no roll-up
        summary fields exist on the master object. You can convert a lookup relationship to a
        master-detail relationship, but only if the lookup field in all records contains a
        value.</p>

      objects. A hierarchical lookup relationship is available only for the user object. It lets you
      use a lookup field to associate one user with another who’s not automatically linked to the

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading8"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Create a Master-Detail Relationship</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Let’s continue with the example of the recruiting app. Interviewers, recruiters, and hiring
      managers create reviews so they can record their comments about each candidate's job
      application, and rate the candidate's suitability for the position. They also read the reviews
      posted by other people. To enable our users to do these tasks, we'll create a custom Review
      object and relate it to the Job Application object.</p>
<p class="p">The Review object has a many-to-one relationship with the Job Application object because one
      job application can have one or more reviews associated with it. A related list on the job
      application record shows the associated reviews, representing the “many” side of
      the relationship.</p>

<span class="image image-block"><img alt="A diagram of the one-to-many relationship between reviews and a job application" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us91905f28d448e1d8ee3aafff733c0ec5.jpg"/></span>
</div>
<p class="p">However, instead of creating this relationship with a lookup relationship field, you can use a
      master-detail relationship field. A master-detail relationship field makes sense in this case
      because reviews lose their meaning when taken out of the context of a job application.
      Accordingly, you want your app to automatically delete reviews when you delete a job
      application to which they're related.</p>
<p class="p">To create the master-detail relationship field to relate the Review object with the Job
      Application object:</p>

</ol>
<p class="p">This sharing setting prevents people from creating, editing, or
deleting a review unless they can also create, edit, or delete the
associated job application. We'll learn about sharing and security
in the next chapter.</p>
<div class="p">Your master-detail relationship is complete! <div class="btb callout box guidedTour"><div class="inner"><div class="bd"><div class="media"><div class="mediaBd"><h4 class="mbs">Beyond the Basics</h4><p>You can also
        create a master-detail relationship with multiple levels. With multilevel master-detail
        relationships, create reports that roll up data from all levels of the data model, and
        trigger cascading deletes when a master record is deleted. For example, you want a
        candidate’s applications and review records to be deleted when a hiring manager
        deletes a candidate. Create a new master-detail relationship field that relates the Job
        Application object with the Candidate object. The Review and Job Application objects are
        already related to each other in a master-detail relationship, so you’ve built a
        multilevel relationship where Candidate is the master, Job Application is the detail, and
        Review is the subdetail.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading10">Create a Many-to-Many Relationship</h2>
<div class="body">
<div class="p"><span class="ph" id="ManytoManyIntro"><a name="ManytoManyIntro"></a>You can use master-detail relationships to model many-to-many
        relationships between any two objects. A many-to-many relationship allows each record of one
        object to be linked to multiple records for another object, and vice versa.</span> For
      example, suppose your recruiting app has a custom object called Website that stores
      information about various employment websites. You want to track which open positions are
      posted to those sites. Use a many-to-many relationship because:<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">One position could be posted on many employment websites.</li>
<li class="li">One employment website could list many positions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Instead of creating a relationship
      field on the Position object that directly links to the Website object, we can link them using
      a junction object. A junction object is a custom object with two master-detail relationships,
      and is the key to making a many-to-many relationship. To create a many-to-many relationship,
      you first create the junction object, then create the two master-detail relationships for
      it.</p>
<p class="p">Let's look at a typical scenario in the recruiting app. There are open positions for a
      Project Manager and a Sr. Developer. The Project Manager position is only posted on
      Monster.com, but the Sr. Developer position is harder to fill, so it's posted on both
      Monster.com and Dice. Every time a position is posted, a job posting record tracks the post.
      As you can see in the following diagram, one position can be posted many times, and both
      positions can be posted to the same employment website. In relational database terms, each job
      posting record is a row in the Job Posting table. Each row consists of a foreign key to a
      position record, and a foreign key to a website record.</p>
<div class="p">So, to define a many-to-many relationship between the Position and Employment Website
      objects, you’d create a Job Posting object with the following fields:<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">A Position master-detail relationship</li>
<li class="li">A Website master-detail relationship</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap"><span class="ph" id="appx_adg_many_to_many_relationship_img"><a name="appx_adg_many_to_many_relationship_img"></a>Using a Job Posting Object to Create a

</div>
<p class="p">To handle this scenario, you can create a junction object called Job Posting. A Job Posting
      record represents a posting about a single position on a single employment website. In
      essence, the Job Posting object has many-to-one relationships with both the Position and
      Website objects. Through those many-to-one relationships, the Job Posting object also creates
      a many-to-many relationship between the Position and Website objects.</p>

<li class="li">Choose <span class="keyword parmname">Master-Detail Relationship</span> as the field type.</li>
<li class="li">Select one of the objects to relate to your junction object. For example, select

</li>
<li class="li">Give your master-detail relationship a name.</li>
<li class="li">Select a <span class="keyword parmname">Sharing Setting</span> option. For master-detail
                relationship fields, the <span class="keyword parmname">Sharing Setting</span> attribute determines

                associated detail records.</li>
<li class="li">Optionally, add your new field to the page layout.</li>
<li class="li">For the <span class="keyword parmname">Related List Label</span> that displays on the page
                  layout of the master object, don’t accept the default. Change the label to the
                  name of the other master object in your many-to-many relationship. For
                example, change it to <kbd class="ph userinput">Websites</kbd> so users see a Websites
                related list on the Position detail page.<div class="box message info"><div class="inner"><div class="bd"><div class="media"><img alt="Note" class="img mtm" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usb473bb5ea1b7e61dfb07e6a7e547de6b.gif"/><div class="mediaBd"><h4 class="mbs">Note</h4><p>We haven’t created a custom object

                  your many-to-many relationship.</span> For example, change it to

</div>
<p class="p" id="JORelatedListIntro"><a name="JORelatedListIntro"></a>For a many-to-many relationship, each master object record displays
        a related list of the associated junction object records. For a seamless user experience,
        change the name of the junction object related list on the master object page layouts to the
        other master object’s name. For example, change the JobPosting related list to
          <kbd class="ph userinput">Positions</kbd> on the websites page layout and to
          <kbd class="ph userinput">Websites</kbd> on the positions page layout. You can further customize
        these related lists to display fields from the other master object. </p>

<p class="p">You can change the parent record for a child record in a master-detail relationship. To
      enable this option, select the Allow reparenting option in the master-detail relationship
      field definition. By default, you cannot “reparent” records in master-detail relationship.</p>
<div class="p">A lookup relationship field is optional but you have the option to make it required. When a
      lookup field is optional, you can specify one of three actions to take place on dependent
      lookup fields when someone deletes a referenced lookup record.<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Clear the value of this field:</strong> This is the default option. Setting a lookup field
          to null is appropriate when the field does not have to contain a value. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Don’t allow deletion of the lookup record that’s part of a lookup relationship</strong>:
          This option restricts the deletion of a lookup record that has dependencies, such as a
          workflow rule built on the relationship.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Delete this record also: </strong>This option cascades the deletion of a referenced lookup
          record to dependent records. It is available only for lookup fields in a custom object;
          however, the lookup field can reference either a standard or custom object. Choose this
          option for tightly-coupled record relationships when you want to completely delete related
          data in one operation</li>
