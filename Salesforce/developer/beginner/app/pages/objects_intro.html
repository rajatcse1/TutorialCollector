<div class="body">
<p class="p">The Force.com platform provides a powerful database, with many features that make
                        it faster and easier to create applications. In a relational database, data
                        is stored in tables. Each table comprises a number of columns of a
                        particular data type, such as text, number, or date. Information is stored
                        in rows of the table. Tables can be related to other tables, using primary
                        and foreign keys. Apps manage information by creating, reading, updating,
                        and deleting rows in a table. </p>
<p class="p">The database in Force.com, on the other hand, uses objects to store data. Objects
                        contain all the functionality you expect in a table, with additional
                        enhancements that make them more powerful and versatile. Each object
                        comprises a number of fields, which correspond to columns in a database.
                        Data is stored in records of the object, which correspond to rows in a
                        database. </p>
<div class="p">There are two types of objects.<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Standard Objects</strong>—These are objects included with
                                        Salesforce, by default, for example the objects used to
                                        store data in standard tabs such as accounts, contacts, or
                                        opportunities.</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Custom Objects</strong>—These are new objects you
                                                create to store information unique to your
                                                organization. Custom objects extend the
                                                functionality that standard objects provide. For
                                                example, if you’re building an app to track product
                                                inventory, you can create custom objects called
                                                Merchandise and Invoices, as shown in the figure
                                                below.</p>

</div>
<p class="p">Objects can have relationship fields that define how records in one object relate
                        to records in another object. These fields play the same role as primary and
                        foreign keys in a database, but they’re more flexible, making it easier to
                        design and implement your data model. </p>
<p class="p">Whether they’re standard or custom, Force.com objects not only provide structure
                        for storing data but also power the interface elements that allow users to
                        interact with the data, such as tabs, the layout of fields on a page, and
                        lists of related records. They also have built-in support for features such
                        as access management, validation, formulas, and history tracking. All
                        attributes of an object are described with metadata, making it easy to
                        create and modify records either through a visual interface or
                        programmatically. </p>
<p class="p">As you can see, objects are a lot more than simply containers for storing data.
                        They provide a rich set of functionality that frees you up to focus on
                        building the features unique to your product. This ensures you can focus
                        your development efforts on the features unique to your product, enhancing
                        productivity and reducing time to market.</p>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading4">Fields and Relationships</h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Each standard or custom object consists of a set of fields. There are several
                        different types of fields, as described below.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading5">Identity Field</h3>
<p class="p">Force.com automatically assigns an identity field (called ID) to every
                                object, and manages the identity data in every record. This identity
                                field usually comes in a 15-character case sensitive form, which you
                                may have already seen while using the platform. For example, when
                                looking at the details of a record, the URL has the form: </p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/0015000000Gv7qJ</pre></div>
<p class="p">Here, <span class="keyword parmname">0015000000Gv7qJ</span> is the identifier for the
                                record. Every record in your application will have such an
                                identifier, and as a result you can view every record (across all
                                objects) by simply using a URL of the above form. The platform will
                                automatically retrieve the record and the associated metadata, and
                                display that record using the automatically generated user
                                interface. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading6">System Fields</h3>
<div class="p">All objects have a number of read-only system fields automatically
                                associated with them. The ID field, discussed above, is one such
                                field. Others include:<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">CreatedDate</strong>—the Date and time when the
                                                object was created  </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">CreatedById</strong>—the ID of the User who created
                                                the object</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">LastModifiedById</strong>—the ID of the User who
                                                last modified the object</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">LastModifiedDate</strong>—the date and time when
                                                the object was last modified by a user  </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">SystemModStamp</strong>—the date and time when the
                                                object was last modified by a user or process, such
                                                as a trigger </li>
</ul>
The database automatically assigns values to these fields when
                                an object is created or modified. </div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading7">Name Field</h3>
<p class="p">The name field of an object is a required field that has a special place
                                in the life of the object. The record name is intended as a
                                human-readable identifier for a record. It's not required to be a
                                unique identifier, but it is supposed to be the primary way users
                                distinguish one record from another. In the automatically generated
                                user interfaces, you’ll see that the value for the name is always
                                displayed as a link to the record itself, to its own detail
                                page.</p>
<p class="p">A name can be one of two types: a text string or an auto-number field.
                                For an auto-number field, you must specify the format for the field
                                and the starting number. Auto number fields increment by one each
                                time a record is created. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading8">Custom Fields</h3>
<p class="p">You can define custom fields, either to extend the functionality of a
                                standard object, or when creating new custom objects. All fields in
                                an object must be defined as a particular data type. Here's a
                                summary of many of the supported data types: </p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Auto Number</strong>—a system-generated read-only sequence
                                        number, analogous to the SQL identity type. These fields can
                                        be used to provide a unique ID that is independent of the
                                        internal object ID. These fields are not used in creating
                                        object relationships. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Checkbox</strong>—for representing Boolean data. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Date or Date/Time</strong>—for representing dates or date
                                        and time combinations. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Number</strong>—for representing real numbers, with
                                        optional decimal points. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Email, Phone and URL</strong>—format-validated email, phone
                                        and URL string representations. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Picklist and Multi-Select Picklists</strong>—represent
                                        values from a list. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Text and Text Areas</strong>—for representing text of
                                        various lengths. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Currency</strong>—a formatted number type, with optional
                                        multi-currency support. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Formula</strong>—a read-only field holding data generated
                                        from a formula expression. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Geolocation</strong>—allows you to identify locations by
                                        their latitude and longitude and calculate distances between
                                        locations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The basic Text, Auto Number and Number are found on many relational
                                databases. The Formula field type is somewhat different to the
                                others. Instead of holding a value, it derives its value from a
                                supplied formula expression. The field is then updated whenever any
                                of the source fields are changed. Checkbox fields, Email fields, URL
                                fields and Phone fields include some automatic formatting
                                capabilities when displayed as part of the automatically generated
                                user interface. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="helpHead3" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading9">Relationship Fields</h3>
<p class="p">The Force.com database differs from relational databases in the way that
                                record relationships are implemented. Instead of having to deal with
                                primary keys and foreign keys, to define relationships between data,
                                Force.com uses relationship fields. A relationship field stores the
                                ID of the parent record in a relationship, as well as optionally
                                providing user interface representations in both the parent and
                                child records.</p>
<p class="p">You can define two types of relationship fields.</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lookup</strong>—This creates a relationship that links one
                                        object to another object. The relationship field allows you
                                        to navigate from records in one object to the related
                                        records in another object (both visually, and
                                        programmatically). Lookup relationships can be used to
                                        create one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Master-Detail</strong>—This creates a special type of
                                        relationship between two objects (the child, or "detail")
                                        and another object (the parent, or "master"). Master-detail
                                        relationships can be used whenever there is a tight binding
                                        between two objects. For example, consider a blog and blog
                                        posts. If the blog is deleted, the blog posts should go too.
                                        They can also be used to create many-many
                                                relationships.<div class="box message info"><div class="inner"><div class="bd"><div class="media"><img alt="Note" class="img mtm" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usb473bb5ea1b7e61dfb07e6a7e547de6b.gif"/><div class="mediaBd"><h4 class="mbs">Note</h4><p>The master object in a master-detail relationship
                                                can also contain rollup summary fields. These fields
                                                store values aggregated from the child records in
                                                the relationship. For example, you can use these
                                                fields to count the number of child records, sum
                                                values in field of a child record, or determine the
                                                maximum/minimum of a field in a filtered set of
                                                child record. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The use of relationship fields greatly simplifies the task of designing
                                and implementing an effective data model for your app.</p>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading10">Other Features of Objects</h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Here is a partial list of features available with all objects.</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Formulas</strong>—Formulas can be used in many places, such as
                                setting up validation rules, creating workflow rule criteria, and
                                even to define a field. A formula field type behaves much like a
                                spreadsheet formula—it reflects some calculation based on
                                other fields and operations on those fields. The formula language is
                                a rich expression language that lets you perform calculations and
                                manipulate strings, dates, numbers and regular expressions. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Validation</strong>—Validation rules help improve data quality by
                                preventing users from saving incorrect data. These rules use the
                                same formula syntax as found in formula field types to define a
                                formula which is evaluated each time a record is saved. If the
                                formula for a validation rule evaluates as “True”, the save is
                                aborted and an error message displayed. You can define one or more
                                validation rules that consist of an error condition and
                                corresponding error message. For example, you can create a
                                validation rule to ensure that a number falls within a particular
                                range. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Triggers</strong>—Triggers, written in the Apex language, are
                                pieces of code that can fire before or after a record is saved,
                                updated or deleted. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Labels</strong>—Every object and record has a label and can include
                                a description, for help, which is automatically included in the user
                                interface. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Notes and Attachments</strong>—You can create, view, and edit notes
                                and add attachments for any record in an object that has this
                                functionality enabled. This provides users of the object the ability
                                to easily add arbitrary text notes, and upload associated documents,
                                for each record. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Track Field History</strong>—Certain fields on your objects can be
                                configured to track their history. Any time a user modifies any of
                                the field data whose history is set to be tracked, a new entry is
                                added to an automatically created History related list. This History
                                list tracks the date, time, nature of the change, and who made the
                                change. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Security</strong>—Database services provide a flexible security
                                model that you can use to control who has access to objects, records
                                and/or fields.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In most cases, you can simply activate and configure these features on your
                        objects to get the desired functionality.</p>
