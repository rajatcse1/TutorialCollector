<p class="p">Let’s say you’re the new all-star developer of the exciting company Cloud Kicks. It makes
   ultra-comfy, stylish, and eco-friendly custom sneakers, designed and personalized for trail
   runners. The shoes are a hit with professional runners and weekend warriors whose idea of a lazy
   Sunday is a 15-mile trail run.</p>
<p class="p">You’re tasked with creating a customer-facing online knowledge base and an internal product
   website for Cloud Kicks employees. All the data comes from the Cloud Kicks Salesforce org. Looks
   like a job for a customized search solution, doesn’t it? Using this scenario, let’s go through a
   few common use cases for customized search solutions. We’ll talk about why you would use a
   particular use case and then give some examples.</p>
<p class="p">To the searchmobile!</p>

<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">Cloud Kicks is a growing startup, and marketing is working hard to get the word out. They’ve
   started several campaigns and have tracked them through Salesforce. Marketing and sales have
   requested a way to search only campaigns on the internal product website that you’re working on.
   Single object searches are best used when users need a quick way to search through one record
   type because they don’t want to be bogged down sifting through records that don’t apply to
   them.</p>
<p class="p">To search within a single object using SOSL, simply specify that object in the request. It’s
   just that easy.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>FIND {term} RETURNING ObjectTypeName</pre></div>
<p class="p">In the example, <samp>term</samp> is what the user enters.
    <span class="keyword parmname">ObjectTypeName</span> limits search results to include only the
    <span class="keyword parmname">sObject</span> specified. So if the user wants to find the March 2016 email
   campaign, the request looks like:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>FIND {march 2016 email} RETURNING Campaign</pre></div>
<p class="p">We’ll get into all the cool stuff you can do with <samp>RETURNING</samp> and how to refine your search for the best results in the next unit.</p>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading4"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Search Within Multiple Objects</span></h2>
<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">Cloud Kicks loves its customers. It wants to build a one-stop-shop for users to ask questions
   and share information on its website. There are multiple types of information included: videos,
   articles, questions, and PDFs. But users don’t really care what type of content is presented.
   They only care that they get the information they need—and fast. That’s what makes the
   multiple object search beneficial: You get to search through multiple objects at the same time
   because the type of record doesn’t matter to the user. Or, perhaps the user actually wants to see
   multiple object types in results.</p>
<p class="p">Luckily, adding another object is super simple in SOSL. Just add a comma-separated list.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>FIND {term} RETURNING ObjectTypeName1, ObjectTypeName2, ObjectTypeNameYouGetTheIdea</pre></div>
<p class="p">Going back to our scenario, a Cloud Kicks customer is wondering if any shoes are made of
   recycled materials. You set up the online knowledge base search so that multiple objects matching
   the terms are returned in the results.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>FIND {recycled materials} RETURNING Product2, ContentVersion, FeedItem</pre></div>
<p class="p">Remember, if you don’t specify an object in the <samp>RETURNING</samp>
   element, it doesn’t show up in the results.</p>

<div class="topic concept nested0" id="search_solution_basics_building_custom" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"><a name="search_solution_basics_building_custom"></a>
<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading5"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Search Within Custom Objects</span></h2>
<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">Salesforce includes numerous standard objects available to customers. But Cloud Kicks is all
      about custom shoes, so it makes sense that it also needs custom objects. Of specific interest
      to you is the newest custom object, Merchandise. This object contains information about the
      style, ID, color, materials, name, and price of all that Cloud Kicks has to offer. Many people
      inside Cloud Kicks need to access this information, including support, sales, and
      shipping.</p>
<p class="p">For the internal product website you’re building, you’re adding a search box that only
      searches the Merchandise custom object. There’s no fancy way to specify custom objects in a
      SOSL search. Include the <span class="keyword parmname">sObject</span> name like any other standard object, and
      append a <samp>__c</samp> suffix.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>FIND {pink hi\-top} RETURNING Merchandise__c</pre></div>

<div class="topic concept nested0" id="search_solution_basics_building_soql" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"><a name="search_solution_basics_building_soql"></a>
<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading6"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>SOQL</span></h2>
<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">We’ve gone on about SOSL, but what SOQL? Well, you use SOQL for single object searches, when
   you know the fields to be searched, when the search term is an exact match for the field (no
   partial or out-of-order matches), when you need number, date, or checkbox field data, and when
   you’re looking for just a few results. (For a full list of when to use SOQL, refer to the first
   module.)</p>
<p class="p">Looking at the previous common use cases in this module, you might have noticed some red flags
   for using SOQL. For example:</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Single object search</strong>—SOQL works when you know which field the data resides in.
    Because we didn’t specify the field for <em class="ph i">march 2016 email</em>, a SOSL search is preferred over
    SOQL. In general, if the query doesn’t specify a target field to search, SOSL works.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Multiple object search</strong>—Because you can only retrieve data from multiple objects
    that are related to one another, the multiple object search in SOQL is limited. In our scenario,
    the objects were unrelated, so SOSL it is.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Custom object search</strong>—As with a single object search, you could search through
    custom objects in SOQL fine. However, we didn’t specify in which field the data resides for our
    search term <em class="ph i">pink hi-top</em>. In addition, SOQL searches against the database, not the index.
    So, let’s say that the record actually included <em class="ph i">pink sneaker hi-top</em>. SOQL wouldn’t be
    able to return the right results.</li>
