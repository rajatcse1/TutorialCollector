<div class="body">
<p class="p">The AppExchange is an online
            marketplace where you can browse, test drive, download, and install pre-built apps and
            components right into your Salesforce environment. There
            are apps on the AppExchange
            for every department, role, and budget, including many that are free.</p>
<p class="p">When you’re looking to solve a business problem and you’re evaluating your options, the AppExchange should be on
            your short list of options to explore. Instead of having to build a solution from
            scratch, you might find a low-cost or free app that solves your business problem at
            hand, plus other valuable apps you didn’t even realize existed.</p>
<p class="p">Let’s start with preparing your overall AppExchange strategy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested0" id="starting_developer_console_nav_src_code" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"><a name="starting_developer_console_nav_src_code"></a>

        Strategy</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Developing a strategy for apps you plan to install is a best practice. This is why we’re
            purposely starting here instead of taking you shopping on the AppExchange right away.
            Without an overall strategy, next thing you know, you’ll have three different apps for
            the same purpose installed in your org.</p>
<p class="p">Follow these steps to develop your AppExchange strategy:</p>
<ol class="ol enumList">
<li class="li">Identify the departments using Salesforce (either now or in
                the future). These are your primary stakeholders for AppExchange app
                installations. </li>
<li class="li">Research AppExchange apps for the
                business cases provided by your stakeholders. Interview your stakeholders thoroughly
                to gather the requirements needed to select and evaluate the apps. Some good
                questions to ask include: <ol class="ol enumList" type="a">
<li class="li">What business problem are you trying to solve? </li>
<li class="li">What are your main pain points at present? </li>
<li class="li">How many users? </li>
<li class="li">What is your budget? </li>
<li class="li">What is your timeline? </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="li">Download apps into a sandbox or Developer Edition org for preview and
                testing. An important step is to ensure that the app you’re installing doesn’t
                interfere with any customizations you’ve done or other apps you’ve already
                installed. This is also a good time to ensure you don’t already have an app
                installed that provides the same functionality.<div class="box message info"><div class="inner"><div class="bd"><div class="media"><img alt="Note" class="img mtm" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usb473bb5ea1b7e61dfb07e6a7e547de6b.gif"/><div class="mediaBd"><h4 class="mbs">Note</h4><p>Sandboxes are copies of your
                    organization in a separate environment. They are used for development and
                    testing. See <a class="xref" href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=create_test_instance.htm&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank">Sandbox Overview</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate your choices. Consider budget, app functionality, and any feature
                gaps. Consider inviting your stakeholders into the sandbox or Developer Edition org
                to preview the app functionality, or invite your stakeholders to a demo of the app. </li>
<li class="li">Execute and document. Prepare your users for the change in user experience
                (if any), including providing training or documentation as needed.</li>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">Once you click <strong class="ph uicontrol">Get It Now</strong>, the installation wizard will guide you
            through the steps. During the installation process, you’ll need to make a few decisions.
            Some of the key ones are:</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList"><li class="li"> Where should I install, production or sandbox? <ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"> In general, an AppExchange best
                        practice is to install first in a sandbox or Developer Edition org. A few
                        considerations: <ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"> Some of the packages come bundled with custom fields, objects, Apex
                                classes, and more. </li>
<li class="li"> All of these customizations have names, which may conflict with
                                existing names in your org. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"> Now that you know what specifically you’re installing, you can decide where
                        you want to install it.<div class="box message info"><div class="inner"><div class="bd"><div class="media"><img alt="Note" class="img mtm" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usb473bb5ea1b7e61dfb07e6a7e547de6b.gif"/><div class="mediaBd"><h4 class="mbs">Note</h4><p>You can preview all of the components in the
                            package during the installation process. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">Do you want to give permissions to admins only, all users, or specific
                        profiles?
                <ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"> Who should have access to these customizations? This is an area where you
                        may want to do a bit of pre-planning before you install, so you don’t have
                        to make updates to profiles and sharing settings after you install. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Once your installation is successful, you’ll receive an email
                    confirmation. Now you’re ready to go!</p>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">Great! You successfully installed your app. But wait, where is it?</p>
<p class="p">Here’s how to find what you just installed:</p>

<li class="li">Click on the name of your installed package, this will be the same name on
                the page where you downloaded the package from the AppExchange [1].<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="The Installed Packages page." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usb5ad7db80b434f6f8e49abbe8991fd34.png"/></span></div></li>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading7"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Other Considerations </span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">As you’re exploring the AppExchange, be sure to
            check out free apps from provider Salesforce Labs. You’ll see
            these apps when browsing the ‘Free’ section of the AppExchange. The great thing
            about Salesforce Labs apps,
            besides being free, is that they’re open source, which means you can customize them as
            needed, and peek under the hood to see how they work. To that last point, Salesforce Labs apps can be a
            great resource as you’re learning how to configure and customize the platform.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, some apps contain tabs, fields, objects, and more. There are
            governors and limits in Salesforce, which your org is subject to. Apps can either be managed or unmanaged, and your
            overall limits are affected in different ways depending on which one you choose. When
            you’re installing any app, keep your limits in mind. You can learn more about this topic
            by viewing the <a class="xref" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.206.0.appExchangeInstallGuide.meta/appExchangeInstallGuide/" target="_blank">AppExchange Installation Guide</a>.</p>
