<div class="body">
<p class="p">Welcome to Salesforce, your
            customer success platform! </p>
<p class="p">Some might think Salesforce is
            CRM only, with a place to store your customer data, processes to nurture and convert
            prospective customers, and ways to collaborate and engage. Salesforce includes those
            things, but it also includes the platform, where customers and partners can use our
            suite of technologies to build amazing, connected apps.</p>
<p class="p">Salesforce has everything you need to run
            your business from anywhere, with products and features to support your needs. Products
            and features available out-of-the-box are called “standard functionality,” and what you
            have access to depends on what you buy.</p>
<p class="p">Here are some examples of standard functionality:</p>
<div class="p">
<div class="data colSort"><table class="featureTable sort_table" summary="">
<thead align="left" class="thead sorted">
<tr>
<th class="featureTableHeader vertical-align-top " id="d470587e81">You need to be able to:</th>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
</div>
<p class="p">Again, this is standard functionality, and what you purchase determines
                    what you have available for use. But what happens when you want to customize
                    standard functionality or build something from scratch?</p>
<p class="p">That’s where the platform comes in. With clicks or code, you can customize
            anything, and what you customize connects to your standard functionality in Salesforce. The platform is your
            secret sauce that can help you make your vision a reality.</p>
<p class="p">Now, let’s take a look at that same table, but with a set of platform
                    examples:</p>

<p class="p">You might be reading that table and thinking, what does all of that mean? Rest assured, we’ll cover those topics in greater detail as you progress through Trailhead. The
                    point is, when you add customizations, whether you’re building an automated email or a beautiful customer-facing app, it means you’re using the
                    platform!</p>

</table></div>
</div>
<p class="p">Now that we’ve got that
                down, let’s walk through a simple platform example in detail.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested0" id="starting_example" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"><a name="starting_example"></a>
<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading4"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Using the Platform</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">The first rule of the platform is don’t be intimidated by the term “platform,” especially
            if you’re coming from a non-programmatic background. Think about it like this: any time
            you’re customizing in Salesforce, with clicks or code, you’re using the platform.</p>
<p class="p">Let’s look at a quick example.</p>
<p class="p">This is a standard Lead record in Salesforce. You use a record
            like this to track people you want to do business with. You’ll see fields for the Name,
            Industry, Annual Revenue, Rating, and other key information, plus fields to track
            contact information, like addresses and phone numbers.<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="A Lead record." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us50e00bfe107d2850b4ad56252cd1b7fe.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">Now, let’s pretend your sales team comes to you for help. They’re
                    having trouble finding the phone number fields at a glance, and they want a
                    place to mark which phone number is preferred.</p>
<p class="p">Think you need to write code to solve for this request? Think again. In Salesforce, you can customize
            the user interface to meet the needs of your sales team with point-and-click tools. </p>
<p class="p">The solution for this scenario is simple. With point-and-click tools, you can
            create a custom field for preferred phone number, and add a new section on the page
            layout [1] just for phone numbers and your new custom field.<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Custom fields on a Lead record." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us5468dde030f791076e858924c887af0f.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">Guess what? We just used the platform! If you don’t know how to update page layouts or
            make custom fields yet yourself, don’t worry. We’ll get there.</p>
<p class="p">The platform makes database and user interface customizations simple, like in this Lead example,
            and also makes complex backend logic and completely customized pages possible with
            programmatic tools like Apex, Visualforce, Lightning Components, and
            more.</p>
<p class="p">Whether you’re
                an administrator, developer, or power user, and whether you’re using clicks or code,
                the platform has tools for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested0" id="starting_declarative_development" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"><a name="starting_declarative_development"></a>
<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading5"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Clicks and Code</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Now is probably a good time to define declarative and programmatic development, and make
            sure that you understand the difference between the two.</p>
<p class="p">Declarative refers to point-and-click functionality in Salesforce. It means that you
            can configure and customize Salesforce without writing code. </p>
<p class="p">Programmatic refers to code-driven functionality in Salesforce. It means that you
            can customize Salesforce using
            programmatic tools like Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning, and standard web
            technologies like JavaScript, CSS, and more.</p>
<p class="p">Check out this table, highlighting some (but not all) of the
                declarative and programmatic options in Salesforce:</p>

</div>
<p class="p">Now, as you
                    start thinking about platform features, resist the temptation to think
                    Declarative = Administrator and Programmatic = Developer. The best developers
                    understand their declarative options, and the best admins know when their use
                    case requires a programmatic solution.</p>
<p class="p">To this end, it’s
                    important to note that most things can be done with clicks, and the golden rule
                    is to always try to build with clicks before going to code, as it is more
                    sustainable and maintainable moving forward. Code is meant to give you more
                    granular control of customization when clicks aren't enough. </p>
<p class="p">In the Salesforce community, some admins
            learn to code, and some developers learn how to fully administer Salesforce. This doesn’t mean
            that every admin has to aspire to becoming a developer, or vice versa. It just means
            that the best admins and developers have a good understanding of both worlds, even if
            they only choose to live in one.</p>
<p class="p">Let’s put this theory to practice and get you started with your
                first platform project. But first, we need to set you up with a practice
                environment. If you’ve already created a Developer Edition for use in Trailhead, you
                can skip this next section.</p>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">A Trailhead Playground (TP) org is a safe environment where you can practice the skills
            you’re learning. You definitely need one as you work through the challenges here on
            Trailhead. For those of you familiar with Developer Edition (DE), the TP is a DE for you
            (our VIP). </p>
<p class="p">TPs come with all the app builder customization tools enabled, like Lightning or
            Apex, so you can use this org as your own personal space for app development.</p>
<p class="p">When you signed up for Trailhead, a TP was automatically created for you. Scroll to the
            bottom of this page and click <strong class="ph uicontrol">Launch your hands-on org</strong> to open
            your TP. If you see a spinning wheel, your TP is still being processed, so wait a few
            more minutes. When you launch your TP from Trailhead, you don’t need to log in with a
            username and password. How convenient is that? If you ever do need your TP login
            credentials, follow the instructions in <a class="xref" href="https://force.desk.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2659738-find-the-username-and-password-for-your-trailhead-playground?b_id=13478" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
<p class="p">TP orgs are free, and you can get a new one whenever you want right here in Trailhead.
            Just go to any hands-on challenge, click the arrow next to <span class="keyword parmname">Launch your
                hands-on org</span>, and select <strong class="ph uicontrol">Create a Trailhead
                Playground</strong>. You can have up to 10 TPs at one time. (Need a fresh org,
            but already have 10 TPs? Either go to your profile and delete a Trailhead Playground
            then create another one, or sign up for a Developer Edition org at
            developer.salesforce.com. There’s no limit to the number of DE orgs you can have.)</p>
<p class="p">Once you’re in, let’s build a simple app.</p>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading7"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Wait...What’s an App?</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">The term “app” means different things to different people, so let’s
                    pause here and make sure you understand what we mean when we say app, and then
                    we’ll move on and build one together.</p>
<p class="p">In Salesforce, an app
            refers to a set of objects, permissions, and functionality to support a business
            process. For example, if you’re having an event and you want people to sign in, you
            could have a paper sheet with columns for Attendee Name, Title, Company, and Email, and
            you could have attendees sign in with a pen. Or you could create an Event app in Salesforce. The sheet becomes an
            object (‘Event’), and those columns become fields (‘Attendee Name’, ‘Title’, ‘Company’,
            ‘Email’) on the object.<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Why use paper when you can use a custom Salesforce app?" class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usedaf206f97842c25807c94e9f4abe513.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">So why would you want to use Salesforce instead of a paper
            sign-in sheet? If the data is in Salesforce, you can:</p>
<div class="p">
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li"> Get real-time access to data as it’s entered, via mobile or desktop.</li>
<li class="li"> Create reports and dashboards to analyze attendees.</li>
<li class="li"> Send follow up emails to attendees after the event.</li>
<li class="li"> Relate attendees to marketing campaigns and sales information, including
                    order and purchase information.</li>
<li class="li"> Engage with attendees in a community.</li>
<li class="li"> Create automated processes to engage with the attendees over time.</li>
<li class="li"> Take advantage of instant scalability, instant mobile access, secure data
                    storage and backups.</li>
<li class="li">
                       And much, much more
                    </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">In fact, Salesforce is a massive,
            relational data store in the cloud. Let’s try it out.</p>

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading8"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Building a Fundraising App</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">At Salesforce, we pioneered the
            1:1:1 model, which donates one percent of our time, equity, and product to non-profit
            organizations. Philanthropy and the<a class="xref" href="http://www.salesforcefoundation.org/" target="_blank"> Salesforce Foundation</a> are important parts of
            our company culture. So what better use case for our app than charitable fundraising?
            Let’s create a fundraising app that can be used to track events for a charitable
            organization.</p>
<p class="p">When you complete this tutorial, you’ll have a working app with its own menu, a tab, and
            a custom object that tracks your fundraising events. Additionally, you’ll have screens
            that allow you to view and edit all of this information. And we’ll get it done faster
            than you expect — in fact, let’s time it! Check your watch and let’s get started!</p>

<p class="p">Now check your watch again. How long did that take you? Now ask yourself, how long would
            it take you to build that using another tool, and then integrate it with Salesforce?</p>
<p class="p">As you explore your app, witness the full power of the platform as you check out
            everything that you just got by building your app on the Salesforce platform:</p>
<ul class="ul bulletList">
<li class="li">A trusted, scalable, performant cloud database to store all your data.</li>
<li class="li">A fully customizable user interface to interact with your data.</li>
<li class="li">A Chatter feed for your
                app, allowing for user collaboration, and sharing comments, files, and more, all in
                the context of your app.</li>
<li class="li">A full-featured reports engine and dashboards to summarize your most important data </li>
<li class="li">An out-of-the-box set of APIs to interact with the data. If you don't know what an API is, we'll get to that
                in just a bit.</li>
<li class="li"> A mobile-ready experience with the Salesforce1 Mobile App. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Wait a second, did someone just say “mobile-ready experience”? That’s right! What you
            just built is ready to go for mobile. If you don’t believe me, stop what you’re doing
            right now and go to Google Play or the App Store and download the Salesforce1 Mobile App, and log in
            with your DE credentials. </p>
<p class="p">You just learned about Salesforce
            standard functionality and the key benefits of building on the platform, including
            scalability, security, mobile access, and more. You’ve also now gotten some practice
            building an app and learned how to emulate the mobile experience right from your
            desktop.</p>
<p class="p">Now that you see how easy it is to get started with the platform, we’ll spend the next
            unit sharing ideas for how to use Salesforce for every department.
