<li class="li"> Trusted Multitenant Cloud: At Salesforce, trust is our #1
                priority, which is why our trusted, multitenant cloud is our foundation for
                everything we build. </li>
<li class="li"> Scalable, Metadata Platform: The secret sauce of our platform is its
                metadata-driven architecture. All customizations in the Salesforce schema, including
                code, configuration, apps, and more, are specified as metadata. In our architecture,
                we keep your metadata layer separate from our services layer, which allows us to

<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading4"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>Trust, Multitenancy, and the Cloud </span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Trust is at the foundation of everything we do, and protecting your data is our #1
            priority. Our platform is built around a robust and flexible security architecture
            trusted by companies around the world, including those in heavily regulated industries.
            Using standard functionality in Salesforce, you get a fine
            degree of security control over everything from user and client authentication, through
            administrative permissions to the data access and sharing model.</p>
<p class="p">Because trust is our #1 priority, we also have a whole website dedicated to trust, and if you
            haven’t yet bookmarked <a class="xref" href="https://trust.salesforce.com" target="_blank">trust.salesforce.com</a>, you should do that right now. On <a class="xref" href="https://trust.salesforce.com" target="_blank">trust.salesforce.com</a>, you can find live performance data, planned
            maintenance, information on our security practices, and more. </p>
<p class="p">When it comes to multitenancy and the cloud, perhaps the easiest way to explain it is with an
            analogy. Multitenancy is a bit like renting office space in an office building. You get
            your own dedicated space, but you share resources for things like power and water, and
            someone else takes care of all the building maintenance for you. For example, if the
            elevator needs maintenance, the building owner handles it for you.<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="A multitenancy analogy." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us4f32f70d1ea71f7f0aedab004cafaf62.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">So what’s
                    the advantage of a multitenant cloud? It means all of our customers, from small
                    businesses to enterprise companies, are on the same code-base and all get the
                    benefits of the same features, functionality, and automatic upgrades 3 times a
                    year. </p>
<p class="p">Let’s talk about those automatic upgrades for a moment. “Enterprise software upgrades” typically
            have a bad reputation. Seriously, just take a moment to think about the last time you
            upgraded an enterprise solution. But Salesforce’s upgrades are
            automatic and seamless. Like an automatic upgrade to first class on a flight or getting
            a new phone or car, when you get upgrades with Salesforce, it’s a good
            thing.</p>
<p class="p">The cloud also means we can deliver Software as a Service (SaaS), which is important because it
            means you don’t have to install a program to use Salesforce. You just need an
            internet connection to log in. </p>
<p class="p">And although you don’t have to install any applications for the desktop browser experience, by
            downloading the Salesforce1 Mobile
            App you can get access to Salesforce anytime, anywhere. </p>

<div class="topic nested0" id="starting_understanding_metadata" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"><a name="starting_understanding_metadata"></a>
<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading5"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>What is Metadata?</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">Metadata literally means data about data. There are different types of metadata, but when
            it comes to our scalable, metadata platform, we’re talking about the structure of your
                Salesforce org. Let’s dive
            in to explain this further.</p>
<p class="p">When you work with Salesforce, you have
            configuration and customization specific to your business needs. This includes things
            like page layouts for your Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and any custom objects. It also
            includes processes, assignment rules, and sharing and security settings. On the
            programmatic side, it might also include things like Visualforce pages and Apex triggers. All of this
            represents what you’ve configured and customized in your org. </p>
<p class="p">Your customer, prospect, and user data is in your org inside all of
                    that structure. Now, imagine all of that data has just been exported. The
                    structure is still there, but the data itself is gone. What you’d have left,
                    that underlying structure, that is the metadata. It’s all of your standard and
                    custom functionality, and all of your configuration and code.</p>
<p class="p">Salesforce’s SaaS model
            means we make the metadata immediately available for development, configuration, and
            usage in your org. This is a big part of why you’re able to go so fast using Salesforce. </p>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">Traditionally, if you wanted to build an app, you’d need hardware and software.
                    You’d have to define access and security, set up reports and analytics, and then
                    actually build the app. If you wanted the app to be mobile and social, you’d
                    have to do some work to set that up, too.</p>
<p class="p">Building an app with Salesforce is
            different. There is no installation of hardware and software, and there are standard
            options for defining security and user access, creating reports, and making the app
            social and mobile. </p>
<p class="p">This is, ultimately, the power of the platform, fueled by the easy accessibility of the metadata
            layer, the cloud, and SaaS. It allows you to innovate quickly, and get to market faster
            with solutions for your customers, partners, and employees.<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Vastly reduce app development time." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usce611e361650a3a733da8f8fa14b543a.png"/></span></div></p>

<div class="topic nested0" id="starting_understanding_api" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"><a name="starting_understanding_api"></a>
<h2 class="helpHead2" id="Tdxn4tBK-heading7"><span class="ph" id="topic-title"><a name="topic-title"></a>All About That API</span></h2>
<div class="body">
<p class="p">If you’re a programmer, you probably already know what an API is. But for those who are
            new to programming, API stands
            for Application Programming Interface, and it’s essentially a contract between two
            pieces of software, allowing them to connect to each other and exchange information.
            Let’s use an analogy to illustrate the point further.</p>
<p class="p">Look at the side of your laptop. You’ll see a series of ports, in different shapes and sizes, for
            different kinds of connections. These are like APIs. Once you connect to
            them, you can exchange information, without knowing any of the inner details of how they
            work. </p>
<p class="p">For example, if you were to plug your headphones into the last port on the right, you should
            start receiving audio information, even though the headphones and the computer don’t
            know how each other works. This is basically a hardware API in action. Similarly,
            software APIs allow two pieces
            of software to communicate with each other via an implied contract.<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="APIs are just like the ports in your laptop." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usc148e42b2321969fdbb4685db3cec5cb.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">Since we’re talking about the API, let’s take a moment to talk about API names and make sure you
            understand what those are. The API name is a unique
            identifier that the platform uses to determine what data or metadata you are trying to
            access. In the example we’re working with right now, we’re going to use your full name,
            and the unique API name for
            your full name is Name. Simple enough, right? </p>
<p class="p">Using this API name, we can show your
            name in the Salesforce1 Mobile App
                [1]:<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Display data in the mobile app." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-usc73c9f6013eadad2ce0280cbe5429d6e.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">We can use your name in a custom Visualforce
            page, to display a welcome message to you [2]:<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Display a customized message to your users." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us37689cf1a4161da09c7fc56317846519.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">We can use your name in a merge field in an email template, to automatically insert your
            signature in an email to a customer [3]:<div class="imagecenter"><span class="image image-block"><img alt="Tailor emails to specific users or customers." class="image image-block" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/image/upload/doc/trailhead/en-us9d10e57651d06d65d2b60ac8fa808bae.png"/></span></div></p>
<p class="p">That’s API names. Now back to
            the API. This part is key. The
            fact that everything about your app, from its metadata to its data, is API-enabled is profoundly
            powerful. It means that you can access your Salesforce data via the API and then visualize it, in
            unique ways you might not have ever imagined. How unique? Try this on for size:</p>
<p class="p"><iframe allowfullscreen="1" class="doc_embedded_video" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="1" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/eb3GgM1o_8I" webkitallowfullscreen="1" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p class="p">When you think about visualizing your CRM data inside of Minecraft, remember that it’s the API that makes that possible. </p>
<p class="p">For more practical use cases of how the Platform APIs enable new and innovative
            use cases, check out <a class="xref" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/wear" target="_blank">Salesforce Wear</a>, which includes a set of apps for Apple
            Watch, Google Glass, and more wearables that all access Salesforce data via APIs.</p>
<p class="p">And if you’re not a programmer, hopefully the examples we’ve shared will show you that APIs are for everyone,
            including you!</p>
