<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles could be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="" height="176" src="project/images/p147.gif" width="361"/></div>
<p>There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:</p>
<p>1x1: 1
<br/>2x1: 4
<br/>3x1: 8
<br/>1x2: 4
<br/>2x2: 18</p>
<p>Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles could be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.</p>
<p>How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller grids?</p>
